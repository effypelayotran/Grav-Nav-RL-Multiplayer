# Grav-Nav-RL-Server
Brown CPFU Vers. 8.28.25

Fork of https://github.com/BrownParticleAstro/Grav-Nav-RL.git but includes multiship orbital environment.

## Orbital Simulation Project üõ∞Ô∏èüöÄ

Simulate 2D orbital maneuvers using **Reinforcement Learning (PPO)**, featuring dynamic visualizations, and customizable training and testing setups.

Test your PPO ship model in a multi-ship orbital simulations, to see if your ship is the last one standing.

## üéÆ How To Run Multiplayer Game Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A modern web browser
- VS Code with Live Server extension (recommended)

### Step 1: Set Up Python Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv grav-nav-env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source grav-nav-env/bin/activate
     ```
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     grav-nav-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets numpy torch stable-baselines3 gym matplotlib
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import fastapi, uvicorn, numpy, torch, stable_baselines3; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Multiplayer Server

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Grav-Nav-RL-Server
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python server_multiship.py
   ```

3. **Verify server is running:**
   - You should see output like: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5500`
   - The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5500`

### Step 4: Open the Game Client

1. **Open VS Code** in the project directory

2. **Install Live Server extension** (if not already installed):
   - Open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Install the extension by Ritwick Dey

3. **Open the game client:**
   - Open `index.html` in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer
   - Select "Open with Live Server"

4. **The game should now be running:**
   - Your browser will open automatically to `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or similar)
   - You should see the orbital simulation interface

### Step 5: Join the Game

1. **Choose your control mode:**
   - Click "Manual Control" to control your ship with keyboard
   - Click "RL Model Control" to let the AI control your ship

2. **Manual Controls (if selected):**
   - **‚Üë** Forward thrust
   - **‚Üì** Reverse thrust  
   - **‚Üê** Left thrust
   - **‚Üí** Right thrust
   - **Space** No thrust

3. **Multiple players:**
   - Open additional browser tabs/windows to `http://127.0.0.1:5500`
   - Each tab represents a different player
   - All players will see each other's ships in real-time

### Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
- Check if port 5500 is already in use: `lsof -i :5500`
- Kill any processes using the port: `kill -9 <PID>`
- Try a different port by modifying `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5500)` in `server_multiship.py`

**Client can't connect:**
- Ensure the server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5500`
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
- Verify firewall settings aren't blocking the connection

**Ships not moving properly:**
- Check that the model file exists at `./models/model_22-51-24-_18-05-2025/ppo_orbital_model.zip`
- Verify the server console for any error messages
- Try refreshing the browser page

**Performance issues:**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Reduce the update rate by modifying the `await asyncio.sleep(0.0167)` value in `server_multiship.py`
- Check system resources (CPU/memory usage)

## üîÑ Communication Schema

### Server State Management
- **`clients` dict**: `{ship_id: {"ws": websocket, "model": model}}`
- **`env.ships` dict**: `{ship_id: {x, y, vx, vy, init_r, done, control_type, heading, thrust, turn_rate, steps}}`
- **`clients_lock`**: Async lock for adding/removing clients

### Client State Management  
- **`myShipId`**: The client's assigned ship ID
- **`ships` dict**: `{ship_id: THREE.Mesh object}` for rendering
- **`connected`**: WebSocket connection status
- **`currentMode`**: 'observe', 'manual', or 'model'

### Message Types

**Server ‚Üí Client:**
- `{"type": "ship_assigned", "ship_id": "uuid"}` - Assigns ship ID to new client
- `{"type": "mode_confirmed", "ship_id": "uuid", "mode": "manual|model"}` - Confirms control mode
- `{"type": "state_update", "ships": {...}, "your_ship_id": "uuid"}` - Broadcasts all ship states

**Client ‚Üí Server:**
- `{"type": "join_mode", "mode": "manual|model"}` - Request to join with specific control mode
- `{"type": "manual_action", "action": float}` - Manual control input (for manual mode)

### Control Flow
1. Client connects ‚Üí Server assigns ship ID ‚Üí Client receives `ship_assigned`
2. Client sends `join_mode` ‚Üí Server confirms with `mode_confirmed`
3. Server runs simulation loop:
   - Processes AI actions for model-controlled ships
   - Processes manual actions for manually-controlled ships
   - Steps environment with all actions
   - Broadcasts `state_update` to all clients
4. Client renders ship positions and handles user input

## üåü Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate spacecraft orbital control. The simulation hooks a model of the user's choice up to controlling thrusts from a spacecraft with the goal of achieving stable orbits under minimal fuel cost

**Core features include:**
- **Training**: Learn optimal control strategies with PPO.
- **Testing**: Evaluate model performance.
- **Rendering**: Visualize the simulation at various stages.
- **Rendering Multiship**: To visualize a simulation of multiple ships orbiting around the same center mass, run the MultipleOrbitalEnvrionment locally by running ```python3 render_multiship_trained.py``` in the terminal. Note that these ships rendered in the multiship environment though are only trained on single body, single ship simulations. They still perform pretty well though.
- **LINODE SERVER SETUP GUIDE!!!:** Rendering MutipleOrbitalEnvironment both locally and on a live server via ```server_multiship.py```. Guide for setting up and developing the live server is here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjSoBIB6DazPc7yJHS8tudBpW7BRP2kl27tRpOFXGAk/edit?usp=sharing
